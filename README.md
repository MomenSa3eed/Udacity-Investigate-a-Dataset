# Udacity-Investigate-a-Dataset
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.
For this project, I will conduct my own data analysis and create a file to share that documents my findings. I will start by taking a look at my dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I will use Pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I am most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. I won't be using inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but I will make it clear in my communications that my findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that you are not looking for one right answer.

## *TMDb movie data* (cleaned from original data on **Kaggle**)
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. 

Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.  
There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column.  
The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.
